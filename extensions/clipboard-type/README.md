# clipboard-type

**Clipboard Type** allows you to "paste" the contents of your clipboard by simulating keystrokes. This is particularly useful in situations where standard pasting is blocked, disabled, or unavailable, such as:

- **Restricted Web Forms**: Bypass restrictions on websites that disable the paste functionality in password or input fields.
- **Remote Desktop (RDP) & VNC**: Type text into remote sessions where clipboard synchronization is inactive or broken.
- **Legacy Applications**: Input text into older applications that may not support standard system paste commands.

**Features:**
- **Type Clipboard Command**: Reads the latest text from your clipboard and types it out character by character.
- **Smart Formatting**: Correctly handles special characters like newlines and tabs by simulating the appropriate key codes.
- **Configurable Speed**: Includes a "Typing Delay" preference (default: 0.002s) to adjust the typing speed, ensuring compatibility with slower interfaces or remote connections.
